# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## I have completed primarily the bare bones requirement 
### I am pushing now in case I can't find more time to add bonus features.
### I spent a little over 3 hours counting some issues with Github not wanting to communicate with this account... 
### I spent the most time exploring styled components as I noticed them in the Job Description and I have not used them before.
### It took me a little while to get them working, but I had fun with them.
### Other than trying to fulfill the basic requirement, Adding styled components was the primary design choice I made.
