# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## This is mostly the bare bones requirement 
## I am pushing now in case I can't find more time to add bonus features.
## I spent the most time exploring styled components as I noticed it in the JD and I have not used them before.
## It took me a little while to get them working, but I had fun with them.
## Other than trying to fulfill the basic requirement, Adding styled components was the primary design choice I made.
